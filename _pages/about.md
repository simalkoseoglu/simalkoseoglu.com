I am a PhD student in Economics at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.econ.lmu.de/index.html). I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Galatasaray University](https://www.gsu.edu.tr/en) and my Master’s degree from [Bonn University](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en).

## Research Focus

I specialize in **Labor and Personnel Economics**, exploring how firm dynamics shape employment, wages, and inequality. My research investigates how organizations evolve, adapt, and influence labor market outcomes by leveraging large-scale datasets. I joined the Economics department at LMU in 2024 as a PhD student, and my work aims to uncover the interactions between firms and workers.

### Gender Norms and the Gender Gap in Volunteerism

This paper examines how gender norms influence the gender gap in volunteerism among second-generation immigrants in the United States. Using an epidemiological approach, I analyze whether cultural norms from maternal countries of origin affect individuals’ participation in formal volunteering. Drawing on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) September Volunteer Supplement (2002–2023), I link second-generation immigrants to the prevailing gender norms in their ancestral countries. The findings indicate that gender norms significantly impact volunteering decisions—with women from less traditional societies showing higher participation rates compared to men. Moreover, the strength of cultural transmission appears greater among individuals with two foreign-born parents, those married within their cultural group, and residents of areas with high concentrations of co-ethnic communities.
